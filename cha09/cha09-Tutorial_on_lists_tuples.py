# (A list with a single object is sometimes referred to as a singleton list.)

# List objects needn't be unique. A given object can appear in a list
# multiple times:
list_a = ["bark", "meow", "woof", "bark", "cheep", "bark"]
print(f"List_a with repeating element 'bark': {list_a}")

""" List Elements Can Be Accessed by Index
Individual elements in a list can be accessed using an index in square
brackets. This is exactly analogous to accessing individual characters in a
string. List indexing is zero-based as it is with strings.
Consider the following list:"""
a = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge"]
print(f"list a --> {a}")
print(f"a[0] --> 'foo' = {a[0]}")
print(f"a[5] --> corge = {a[5]}")

# Virtually everything about string indexing works similarly for lists. For
# example, a negative list index counts from the end of the list:
print(f"a[-1] --> last element --> corge = {a[-1]}")
print(f"a[-2] --> 'quux' --> {a[-2]}")

# Slicing also works. If a is a list, the expression a[m:n] returns the
# portion of a from index m to, but not including, index n:
print(f"a[2:5] --> 'baz', 'qux', 'quux' --> {a[2:5]} ")

# Other features of string slicing work analogously for list slicing as well:
# Both positive and negative indices can be specified:
print(f"a[-5:-2] --> 'baz', 'qux', 'quux' --> {a[-5:-2]} ")

# Omitting the first index starts the slice at the beginning of the list, and
# omitting the second index extends the slice to the end of the list:
print(f"a[:4], a[0:4] --> {a[:4], a[0:4]}")
print(f"a[2:], a[2:len(a)] --> {a[2:], a[2:len(a)]}")
print(f"a[:4] + a[4:] --> {a[:4] + a[4:]}")
print(f"a[:4] + a[4:] == a --> True = {a[:4] + a[4:] == a}")


# ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge']
# You can specify a stride (the third parameter stride means steps to jump, for
# example a[0:5:2] --> start on 0 until 5 selecting every 2 elements)â€”either
# positive or negative, this is if the stride/step is + then from left to right
# if it is negative then from right to left:
print(f"a[0:5:2] --> ['foo', 'baz', 'quux'] = {a[0:5:2]}")
# ['foo', 'baz', 'quux']
print(f"a[1:6:2] --> ['bar', 'qux', 'corge'] = {a[1:6:2]}")
print(f"a[6:0:-2] --> ['corge', 'qux', 'bar'] = {a[6:0:-2]}")

# The syntax for reversing a list works the same way it does for strings:
print(f"a[::-1] --> ['corge', 'quux', 'qux', 'baz', 'bar', 'foo'] = {a[::-1]}")

# Now reversing and striding/steping every 2 elements:
print(f"a[::-2] --> ['corge', 'qux', 'bar'] = {a[::-2]}")

# The [:] syntax works for lists. However, there is an important difference
# between how this operation works with a list and how it works with a string:
s = "foobar"
print(f"s --> 'foobar' = {s} AND s[:] --> 'foobar' = {s[:]}")
# In string s and s[:] make reference to the same object or same address,
# this is:
print(f"s is s[:] --> True = {s is s[:]}")
# or:
print(f"id(s) == id(s[:]) --> True = {id(s) == id(s[:])}")
# or:
print(f"s == s[:] --> True = {s == s[:]}")

# Conversely, if 'a' is a list, a[:] returns a new object that is a copy of
# the content of 'a' but in a different memory address/location. This is why
# in previous chapter we saw that in order to copy one object into another one
# in a way that their content be independent, not impacted when we change one
# of them; then we have to use the [:] notation.
a = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge"]
b = a[:]
print(f"a is b --> False = {a is b}")
# or:
print(f"a is a[:] --> False = {a is a[:]}")
# or:
print(f" id(a[:]) --> {id(a[:])}")
print(f"id(a) == id(a[:]) --> False = {id(a) == id(a[:]) }")
print(f"id(a) == id(b) --> False = {id(a) == id(b)}")

# Several Python operators ('in' and 'not in') and built-in functions can
# also be used with lists in ways that are analogous to strings:
a = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge"]
print(f"a --> {a}")
# the 'in' operaator:
print(f"'qux' in a --> True = {'qux' in a}")
# the 'not in' operator:
print(f"'thud' not in a --> True = {'thud' not in a}")

# Concatanating (+) two lists:
print(
    f"list concatation: a + ['grault', 'garply'] --> \
{a + ['grault', 'garply']}"
)

# Replication (*) of a list: this create a new list x times:
print(f"a * 3 --> {a * 3}")

# the len(), min() and max() functions:
print(f"len(a) --> 6 = {len(a)}")
print(f"min(a) --> 'bar' = {min(a)}")
print(f"max(a) --> 'qux' = {max(a)}")

# lists and strings have similar behavior because they their parent class is
# the general iterable class.
# the examples above were using a list assigned to a variable; but we can make
# them on a "list literal" as follow:
print(f"list literal: {['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge']}")
print(
    f"index [2] in literal list --> 'baz' =  \
{['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge'][2]}"
)
print(
    f"reversed literal list--> \
{['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge'][::-1]} "
)
print(
    f"quux in literal list? --> True = \
{'quux' in ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge']}"
)
print(
    f"len of reversed literal list --> 6 =  \
{len(['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge'][::-1])} "
)

print("If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."[::-1])

# Lists can be Nested:
# Elements i a list can be any type of object. This include another list. A
# list can contain sublists, which in turn can contain sublists themselves, and
# so on to arbitrary depth.

print(f"sublist x[3] --> ['hh', 'ii'] = {x[3]}")
print(f"the second element in x[3] sublist: x[3][1] --> 'ii' = x[3][1]")

# for acessing the elements of another sublist inside of a sublist, we just
# need to add another index x[][][].

# There is no limit, only the computer memory, to the depth or complexity with
# which lists can be nested in this way.

# All the ususal syntax regardding indices and slicing applies to sublists
# as well:
print(
    f"To get the last element in a sublist x[1][1][-1] --> 'ddd' = \
{x[1][1][-1]}"

to append this [::-1] after the slice x[1][1:3][::-1] --> \
['ee', ['ccc', 'ddd']] = {x[1][1:3][::-1]}"
)
# The above can be obtained as follow:
sublist_1 = x[1][1:3]  # slice the sublist
reversed_sublist_1 = sublist_1[::-1]  # now reverse it.
print(f"reversed_sublist_1 = {reversed_sublist_1}")

print(f"Reversing the x[3] sublist: x[3][::-1] --> ['ii', 'hh'] = {x[3][::-1]}")

# however, be aware that operators and functions apply to only the list at the
# level we specify and are not recursive. Consider what happens when we query
# the length of x using len() built-in function:
print(f"len(x) --> 5 = {len(x)}")
# This does not count the elements in any of the sublists in 'x' list.
# x has only five elements - 3 strings and 2 sublists. the individual elements
# in the sublists don't count toward x's length.
# We will encounter a similar situation when using the 'in' operator:
print(f"'ddd' in x? --> False = {'ddd' in x}")
print(f"'ddd' in x[1]? --> False = {'ddd' in x[1]}")
print(f"'ddd' in x[1][1]? --> True = {'ddd' in x[1][1]}")
# 'ddd' is not one of the elements in x or x[1]. It is only directly an element
# in the sublist x[1][1]. An indivial element in a sublist DOES NOT count as an
# element in the parent list(s).

""" Lists Are Mutable
Most of the data types you have encountered so far have been atomic types.
Integer or float objects, for example, are primitive units that can't be further
broken down. These types are immutable, meaning that they can't be changed once
they have been assigned. It doesn't make much sense to think of changing the
value of an integer. If you want a different integer, you just assign a
different one.

By contrast, the string type is a composite type. Strings are reducible to
smaller partsâ€”the component characters. It might make sense to think of
changing the characters in a string. But you can't. In Python, strings are
also immutable.

The list is the first mutable data type you have encountered. Once a list has
been created, elements can be added, deleted, shifted, and moved around at will.
Python provides a wide range of ways to modify lists.

Modifying a Single List Value
A single value in a list can be replaced by indexing and simple assignment:"""
a = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge"]
print(f"List a: {a}")
a[2] = 10
a[-1] = 20
print(f"List a with 2 and last element mofidifed: {a}")

# In a string object we cannot make item assignment:
s = "foobarbaz"
# s[2] = "x"  # this will trigger a typeError
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

# A list item can be deleted with the del command:
del a[3]
print(f"List a with item [3]='qux' deleted: {a}")

# Modifying Multiple List elements/items values:
# What if you want to change the valaue of several contiguous elements in a list
# at one time? Python allows this with slice assignment, which has this syntax:
# a[m:n] = <iterable>.
# Again, for the moment, think of an iterable as a list. This assignment
# replaces the specified slice of the list 'a' with <iterable>

print(f"modifying single element a[1] = [2.1, 2.2, 2.3] --> {a}")

# <index> defaults to -1, so a.pop(-1) is equivalent to a.pop()

# Lists Are Dynamic:
""" This totorial bega with a list of sixs defining characteristics of Python
lists. The last one is that lists are dynamic. We have seen many examples of
this in the sections above. This is, when items are added ot a list, it grows as
needed:"""
a = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge"]
print(f"a --> {a}")
a[2:2] = [1, 2, 3]
a += [3.14159]
print(f"a --> {a}")
# a --> ['foo', 'bar', 1, 2, 3, 'baz', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge', 3.14159]

# Similarly, a list shrinks to accommodate the removal of items:
a = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge"]
print(f"a --> {a}")
a[2:3] = []  # delete item at index 2
del a[0]
print(f"a, after deleting a[2:3] and a[0] --> {a}")
# a, after deleting a[2:3] and a[0] --> ['bar', 'qux', 'quux', 'corge']


# Defining a Tuple:
""" Tuples are identical to lists in all respects, except for the following
properties:
1- Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses () instead of
square brackets [].
2- Tuples are immutable.
Here is a short example showing a tuple definition, indexing, and slicing:
"""
t = ("foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge")
print(f"Tuple t --> {t}")
print(f"element at index=0 --> foo = {t[0]}")
print(f"last element in the tuple t[-1] --> corge = {t[-1]}")
print(
    f"a slice starting at index=1 till end striding every 2 elements \
t[1::2] --> ('bar', 'qux', 'corge') = {t[1::2]}"
)
# Never dear! Our favorite string and list reversal mechanism works for tuples
# as well:
print(f"Reverse striding every 1: t[::-1] --> {t[::-1]}")
# --> ('corge', 'quux', 'qux', 'baz', 'bar', 'foo')
print(f"Reverse striding every 2: t[::-2] --> {t[::-2]}")
# --> ('corge', 'qux', 'bar')
print(f"Reverse striding every 3: t[::-3] --> {t[::-3]}")
# ('corge', 'baz')

# Note: Even though tuples are defined using parentheses, we still index and
# slice tuples using square brackets, like in strings and lists.

# Everything we've learned about lists - they can be ordered, they can contain
# arbitrary objects, they can be indexed and sliced, they can be nested - is
# true for tuples as well. But they can NOT be modified, because tupls are
# immutable:
t = ("foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge")
# t[2] = "Bark!"
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "C:\PythonBasicsBookExercises\cha09\cha09-Tutorial_on_lists_tuples.py", line 529, in <module>
#     t[2] = "Bark!"
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment


# Why to use a tuple instead of a list????
# 1- Program execution is faster when manipulating a tuple than it is for the
#    equivalent list. (This probably not going to be noticeable when the list
#    or tuple is small)
# 2- Sometimes we don't want data to be modified. If the values in the
#    collection are meant to remain constant for the life of the program, then
#    using tuple instead of a list guards against acidental modification.
# 3- There is another Python data type, the dictionary, which requires as one
#    of its components a value that is of an immutable type. A tuple can be
#    used for this purpose, wheraas a list cannot be.

# In a Python REPL session, we can display the values of several objects
# simultaneously by entering them directly at the >>> prompt, separated by
# commas:
# >>> a = "foo"
# >>> b = 42
# >>> a, 3.14159, 42
# displays: ('foo', 3.14159, 42)

# Python displays the respose in parentheses because it is implicitly
# interpreting the input as a tuple.


# There is one peculiarity regarding tuple definition that we should be aware
# of. There is no ambiguity when defining an empty tuple, nor one with two or
# more elements. Python knows that we are defining a tuple:
# >>> t = ()
# >>> type(t)
# <class 'tuple'>

# >>> t = (1, 2)
# >>> type(t)
# <class 'tuple'>

# >>> t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# >>> type(t)
# <class 'tuple'>

# But what happen when we try to define a tuple with one item:
# >>> t = (2)
# >>> type(t)
# <class 'int'>

# Doh!!! Since parentheses are also used to define operator precedence in
# expressions, Python evaluates the expression (2) as simple the integer 2 and
# creates an integer object. To tell Python that we really want to define a
# singleton tuple, we have to include a trailing comma (,) just before the
# closing parenthesis:
# >>> t = (2,)
# >>> type(t)
# <class 'tuple'>

# >>> t[0]
# 2

# >>> t[-1]
# 2

# We probably won't need to define a singleton tuple often, but there has to
# be a way. When we display a singleton tuple, Python includes the comma, to
# remind us that it's a tuple:
t = (2,)
print(f"The singleton tuple t = (2,) is printed with ',' --> {t}")


# Tuple Assignment, Packing, and Unpacking:
# As we already have seen above, a 'literal' tuple containing several items can
# be assigned to a single object:
t = ("foo", "bar", "baz", "quz")
print(
    f"a literal tuple assigned to an object 't' -->\
t = ('foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'quz')"
)
# When this occurs, it is as if the items in the tuple have been 'packed' into
# the object 't' and we can say that  't' is a 'packed' object:
print(f"t -- > {t}")
print(f"f[0] --> {t[0]}")
print(f"f[-1] --> {t[-1]}")

# if the 'packed' object is subsequently assigned to a new tuple, the individual
# items are 'unpacked' into the objects in the new tuple:
(s1, s2, s3, s4) = t
print("(s1, s2, s3, s4) = t")
print(f"s1 --> {s1}")
print(f"s2 --> {s2}")
print(f"s3 --> {s3}")
print(f"s4 --> {s4}")

# When unpacking a tuple, the number of variables on the left must match the
# number of values/items in the tuple. If they do not match, then below errors:
""" >>> (s1, s2, s3) = t

# In assignment like this and a small handful of other situations, Python
# allows the parentheses that are usually used for denoting a tuple to be
# left out:

t = 1, 2, 3
print("t = 1, 2, 3")
print(f"t --> {t}")

x1, x2, x3 = t
print("x1, x2, x3 = t")
print(f"x1, x2, x3 --> (1, 2, 3) = {x1, x2, x3}")

print("x1, x2, x3 = 4, 5, 6")
print(f"x1, x2, x3 --> (4, 5, 6) = {x1, x2, x3}")

t = (2,)
print("t = 2,")
print(f"t --> (2,) = {t}")
# It works the same whether the parentheses are included or not, so if we have
# any doubt as to wheter they're needed, go ahead and include them.

# Tuple assignment allows for a curious bit of idiomatic Python. Frequently
# when programming, we have two variables whose values we need to swap. In most
# programming languages, it is necessary to store one of the value in a
# temporary variable while the swap occurs like this:
a = "foo"
b = "bar"
print(f"a, b --> ('foo', 'bar') = {a, b}")
# we need to define a temp variable to accomplish the swap:
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
print(f"after the swap: a, b --> ('bar', 'foo') = {a, b}")
# In Python, the swap can be done with a single tuple assignment:
a = "foo"
b = "bar"
print(f"a, b --> ('foo', 'bar') = {a, b}")
# Now applying the Magic of Python tuple assignment:
a, b = b, a  # Python pack the tuple(b, a) and unpack it in tuple (a, b)
print(
    f"after the pack-unpack: a, b = b, a, the tuple (a, b) is \
swapped to ('bar', 'foo') = {a, b}"
)

# As anyone who has ever had to swap values using a temporary variable knows,
# being able to do it this way in Python is the pinnacle of modern
# technological achievement. It will never get better than this.


""" Conclusion
This tutorial covered the basic properties of Python lists and tuples, and how
to manipulate them. You will use these extensively in your Python programming.

One of the chief characteristics of a list is that it is ordered. The order of
the elements in a list is an intrinsic property of that list and does not
change, unless the list itself is modified. (The same is true of tuples,
except of course they can't be modified.)

The next tutorial will introduce you to the Python dictionary: a composite
data type that is unordered. Read on!"""
